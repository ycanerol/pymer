# pymer
Collection of **Py**thon scripts for analyzing extracellular **m**ulti**e**lectrode
array recordings from the **r**etina in the Gollisch lab, GÃ¶ttingen.

# Installing
## Random Number Generator
The random number generator should be setup by running the setup.py file in
/randpy as described in the readme file there.

## User Configuration
The file `pymer_config_default.json` is meant to be read-only. Local configurations
may be set with a file `.pymer_config` in your home directory. These will
override the default configuration.

A local setting *root_experiment_dir* is necessary for most functions.

To set your local configuration, create an empty file named ".pymer_config" at
your home directory (`/home/<username>` for Linux and Mac and
`C:\Users\<username>` for Windows)
and add the desired options. See the default configuration file for all options.

A minimum working example to get you started would be:
```json
{
        "root_experiment_dir" : "/home/<username>/mydata/"
}
```
